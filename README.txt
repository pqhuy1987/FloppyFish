PROJECT: Floppy Fish HD iOS Game 

LANGUAGES EMPLOYED: Objective-C

DESCRIPTION: This is a personal project that I became really passionate about after I heard "Flappy Bird" was being taken off the market. It started out as a joke among friends that I would create a new game and a make a lot of money to ride the Flappy Bird wave of excitement... like every other developer I realized at the time. However, unlike many developers, I chose not to use drag and drop software solutions or game engines. I wanted to undertake the challenge to make the game from scratch. 

Features:
* Choose animated background 
* Universal leaderboard (if connected to internet and game center)
* Unlockable fish at 25, 50 and 100 points
* Animated seaweed and fish sprites


HOW TO PLAY

2. RULES: Tap rapidly to jump. Avoid seaweed or stones.
